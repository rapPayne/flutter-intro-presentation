- [Checkpoint 1](solutions/cp1) - The boilerplate app with a new TodoApp stateful widget. Super simple.
- [Checkpoint 2](solutions/cp2) - New Todo business class. Initialized `List<Todo>`. Iterating them as `Text()`s
- [Checkpoint 3](solutions/cp3) - Changed the Texts to ListTiles.
- [Checkpoint 4](solutions/cp4) - Tapping the Todo now toggles the check_box icon.
- [Checkpoint 5](solutions/cp5) - Added the AddTodo widget. Can navigate between the two scenes.
- [Checkpoint 6](solutions/cp6) - Added a TextFormField. Passing the todo description back to TodoApp.
- [Checkpoint 7](solutions/cp7) - Adding the new Todo to the list and re-rendering the scene to draw it.
- [Checkpoint 8](solutions/cps8) - InputDecorations added to the TextFormField
- [Checkpoint 9](solutions/cp9) - Reading and saving all Todos to shared preferences
